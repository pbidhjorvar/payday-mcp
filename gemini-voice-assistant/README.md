**Request:**

{
  "query": "What are the top accounts by transaction count?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "fulfillmentText": "The query returned 5 results.",
  "generatedSql": "SELECT account_code, account_name, transaction_count FROM gold.account_summary ORDER BY transaction_count DESC LIMIT 5",

## Example Queries

- "What are the top accounts by transaction count?"
- "Show me the account balances"
- "What's our cash flow this month?"
- "Which accounts have the highest activity?"
- "Show me recent transactions"

## Database Schema

The webhook connects to your populated DuckDB database with:

- **Gold Schema**: Business-ready analytical views (account_summary, etc.)
- **Silver Schema**: Clean transaction and account data
- **Bronze Schema**: Raw data views

## Security

- Database is opened in READ_ONLY mode
- Only SELECT statements are allowed
- Query validation prevents data modification
- Basic input sanitization

## Development

The project uses TypeScript and includes:
- Express.js web server
- Google Generative AI SDK
- DuckDB Node.js driver
- Development hot reload with nodemon

## Integration Notes

This is a basic webhook implementation. For full Google Assistant integration, you'll need to:

1. Deploy to a public server (or use ngrok for testing)
2. Configure Google Actions Console
3. Set up proper authentication
4. Handle Google Assistant-specific request/response formats
