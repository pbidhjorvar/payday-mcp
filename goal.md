# Project Goal

## What We're Building

We're creating an AI assistant that can help with accounting tasks by talking directly to the Payday accounting system.

## The Vision

Instead of manually logging into Payday to check invoices, create journal entries, or review financial data, you can simply ask Claude questions in plain English and get immediate answers or have tasks completed automatically.

## What This Enables

**Ask Questions About Your Business:**
- "How much money do we have outstanding from customers?"
- "What expenses did we have last month?"
- "Which invoices are overdue?"
- "Show me our cash flow for Q3"

**Get Tasks Done Automatically:**
- "Mark invoice #1234 as paid"
- "Create a journal entry for this office supply receipt"
- "Record this bank transaction as a consulting expense"
- "Generate a monthly financial summary"

**Semi-Automated Accounting:**
- Read bank account transactions automatically
- Match bank transactions to invoices and expenses
- Create proper journal entries for bank activity
- Reduce manual data entry and human error
- Keep books up-to-date with minimal effort

## The End Goal

Transform accounting from a manual, time-consuming process into a conversation with an AI that understands your business finances. The AI can read your bank data, match it with your Payday records, and create the proper accounting entries - making bookkeeping as simple as explaining what happened in plain language.

This means spending less time on data entry and more time understanding and growing your business.
